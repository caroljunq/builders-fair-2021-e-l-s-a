E.L.S.A is a solution that helps to monitor one of the most important steps for vaccines - transportation delivery. The solution provides information about package location and temperature. Using ML and analytics services, E.L.S.A. shows near real-time dashboards about vaccinesâ€™ package status and location, and alerts the stackholders (managers, truck drivers, etc.) if there is a problem with the package (ex: high temperatures, location audit).
