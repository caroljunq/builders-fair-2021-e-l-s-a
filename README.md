E.L.S.A is a solution that helps to monitor one of the most important steps for vaccines - transportation delivery. The solution provides information about package location and temperature. Using ML and analytics services, E.L.S.A. shows near real-time dashboards about vaccinesâ€™ package status and location, and alerts the stackholders (managers, truck drivers, etc.) if there is a problem with the package (ex: high temperatures, location audit).

The architecture can be divided in 3 parts:
- [IoT](https://github.com/caroljunq/builders-fair-2021-e-l-s-a/tree/main/iot-sensor-steps)
- [Analytics and ML](https://google.com)
- [Front-end](https://github.com/caroljunq/builders-fair-2021-e-l-s-a/tree/main/elsap) 

Each of sections above contains instructions and steps to reproduce the solution.
