# Application Development
The application was developed with Angular 12.2.8, Node 14.18.0. We used some key libraries for the project:
- **Quicksight SQK** - https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk
- **ApexCharts.js** - https://apexcharts.com/

To run the application, run the commands below in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/caroljunq/builders-fair-2021-e-l-s-a.git

cd builders-fair-2021-e-l-s-a

cd front-end

npm install

npm start
```

If you want to build a static website to host somewhere, you can use:

```
ng build # requires install of Angular Cli
```
